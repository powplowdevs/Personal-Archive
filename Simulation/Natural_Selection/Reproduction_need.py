#Create a world
#Create a mouse {Need_to_reproduce, strength, food}
#Create a tree {used}
 
#Make a x amt of starting mouse's
#Make an x amt of starting trees
 
#Every day each mouse will go out in search of food and will have a 100% chance to find it
#Once the mouse has obtained a piece of food a chance equal to (Need_to_reproduce/10) will be rolled
#If that chance is positive then the mouse will go looking for another piece of food.
#Note that its not guaranteed that the mouse will get food as there may be none left
#Regardless once the mouse decides to go looking for a second piece of food a random chance will be rolled
#The chance is equal to (strength/10) if the chance is positive then the mouse will go home with 2 food
#If its not it will die
#If the mouse has 2 food at the end of the day it will have a 100% chance to reproduce and its strength will be +1
#If the mouse has 1 food at the end of the day it will have a 0% chance to reproduce and its strength will be +1
